def _eval_deriv_contractions(coords, orders, center, angmom_comps, alphas, prim_coeffs, norm):
    """Return the evaluation of the derivative of a Cartesian contraction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coords : np.ndarray(N, 3)
        Point in space where the derivative of the Gaussian primitive is evaluated.
        Coordinates must be given as a two dimensional array, even if one coordinate is given.
    orders : np.ndarray(3,)
        Orders of the derivative.
        Negative orders are treated as zero orders.
    center : np.ndarray(3,)
        Center of the Gaussian primitive.
    angmom_comps : np.ndarray(L, 3)
        Component of the angular momentum that corresponds to this dimension.
        Angular momentum components must be given as a two dimensional array, even if only one
        is given.
    alphas : np.ndarray(K,)
        Values of the (square root of the) precisions of the primitives.
    prim_coeffs : np.ndarray(K, M)
        Contraction coefficients of the primitives.
        The coefficients always correspond to generalized contractions, i.e. two-dimensional array
        where the first index corresponds to the primitive and the second index corresponds to the
        contraction (with the same exponents and angular momentum).
    norm : np.ndarray(L, K)
        Normalization constants for the primitives in each contraction.

    Returns
    -------
    derivative : np.ndarray(M, L, N)
        Evaluation of the derivative at each given coordinate.
        Array is three dimensional, where the first index corresponds to the contraction, second
        index corresponds to the angular momentum vector, and the third index corresponds to the
        coordinate for the evaluation.

    Notes
    -----
    The input is not checked. This means that you must provide the parameters as they are specified
    in the docstring. They must all be numpy arrays with the **correct shape**.

    Pople style basis sets are not supported. If multiple angular momentum vectors (with different
    angular momentum) and multiple contraction coefficients are provided, it is **not assumed** that
    the angular momentum vector should be paired up with the contraction coefficients. In fact, each
    angular momentum vector will create multiple contractions according to the given coefficients.
