        r"""Return the evaluations of the given contractions at the given coordinates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        contractions : GeneralizedContractionShell
            Contracted Cartesian Gaussians (of the same shell) that will be used to construct an
            array.
        points : np.ndarray(N, 3)
            Cartesian coordinates of the points in space (in atomic units) where the basis
            functions are evaluated.
            Rows correspond to the points and columns correspond to the :math:`x, y, \text{and} z`
            components.

        Returns
        -------
        array_contraction : np.ndarray(M, L_cart, N)
            Evaluations of the given Cartesian contractions at the given points.
            Dimension 0 corresponds to segmented contractions within the given generalized
            contraction (same exponents and angular momentum, but different coefficients). `M` is
            the number of segmented contractions with the same exponents (and angular momentum).
            Dimension 1 corresponds to angular momentum vector. `L_cart` is the number of Cartesian
            contractions for the given angular momentum.
            Dimension 2 corresponds to coordinates at which the contractions are evaluated. `N` is
            the number of coordinates at which the contractions are evaluated.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If contractions is not a `GeneralizedContractionShell` instance.

def evaluate_basis(basis, points, transform=None, screen_basis=True, tol_screen=1e-8):
    r"""Evaluate the basis set in the given coordinate system at the given points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    basis : list/tuple of GeneralizedContractionShell
        Shells of generalized contractions.
    points : np.ndarray(N, 3)
        Cartesian coordinates of the points in space (in atomic units) where the basis
        functions are evaluated.
        Rows correspond to the points and columns correspond to the :math:`x, y, \text{and} z`
        components.
    transform : np.ndarray(K, K_cont)
        Transformation matrix from the basis set in the given coordinate system (e.g. AO) to linear
        combinations of contractions (e.g. MO).
        Transformation is applied to the left, i.e. the sum is over the index 1 of `transform`
        and index 0 of the array for contractions.
        Default is no transformation.
    screen_basis : bool, optional
        A toggle to enable or disable screening. Default value is True (enable screening).
    tol_screen : float, optional
        The tolerance used for screening overlap integrals. `tol_screen` is combined with the
        minimum contraction exponents to compute a cutoff radius which is compared to the distance
        between the points and the contraction centers to decide whether the basis function
        should be evaluated or set to zero at that point.

    Returns
    -------
    eval_array : np.ndarray(K, N)
        Evaluations of the basis functions at the given points.
        If keyword argument `transform` is provided, then the transformed basis functions will be
        evaluated at the given points.
        `K` is the total number of basis functions within the given basis set.
        `N` is the number of coordinates at which the contractions are evaluated.
