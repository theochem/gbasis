    ----------
    _axes_contractions : tuple of tuple of GeneralizedContractionShell

        Return the evaluations of the linear combinations of contractions in the given coordinate
        system.

    def construct_array_contraction(contractions, points):
        r"""Return the evaluations of the given contractions at the given coordinates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        contractions : GeneralizedContractionShell
            Contracted Cartesian Gaussians (of the same shell) that will be used to construct an
            array.
        points : np.ndarray(N, 3)
            Cartesian coordinates of the points in space (in atomic units) where the basis
            functions are evaluated.
            Rows correspond to the points and columns correspond to the :math:`x, y, \text{and} z`
            components.

        Returns
        -------
        array_contraction : np.ndarray(M, L_cart, N)
            Evaluations of the given Cartesian contractions at the given points.
            Dimension 0 corresponds to segmented contractions within the given generalized
            contraction (same exponents and angular momentum, but different coefficients). `M` is
            the number of segmented contractions with the same exponents (and angular momentum).
            Dimension 1 corresponds to angular momentum vector. `L_cart` is the number of Cartesian
            contractions for the given angular momentum.
            Dimension 2 corresponds to coordinates at which the contractions are evaluated. `N` is
            the number of coordinates at which the contractions are evaluated.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If contractions is not a `GeneralizedContractionShell` instance.
            If points is not a two-dimensional `numpy` array with 3 columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    basis : list/tuple of GeneralizedContractionShell
        Shells of generalized contractions.
    points : np.ndarray(N, 3)
        Cartesian coordinates of the points in space (in atomic units) where the basis

    transform : np.ndarray(K, K_cont)
        Transformation matrix from the basis set in the given coordinate system (e.g. AO) to linear
        combinations of contractions (e.g. MO).

        and index 0 of the array for contractions.
        Default is no transformation.

    Returns
    -------
    eval_array : np.ndarray(K, N)
        Evaluations of the basis functions at the given points.
