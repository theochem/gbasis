        r"""Return the evaluations of the given contractions at the given coordinates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        contractions : GeneralizedContractionShell
            Contracted Cartesian Gaussians (of the same shell) that will be used to construct an
            array.
        points : np.ndarray(N, 3)
            Cartesian coordinates of the points in space (in atomic units) where the basis
            functions are evaluated.
            Rows correspond to the points and columns correspond to the :math:`x, y, \text{and} z`
            components.

        Returns
        -------
        array_contraction : np.ndarray(M, L_cart, N)
            Evaluations of the given Cartesian contractions at the given points.
            Dimension 0 corresponds to segmented contractions within the given generalized
            contraction (same exponents and angular momentum, but different coefficients). `M` is
            the number of segmented contractions with the same exponents (and angular momentum).
            Dimension 1 corresponds to angular momentum vector. `L_cart` is the number of Cartesian
            contractions for the given angular momentum.
            Dimension 2 corresponds to coordinates at which the contractions are evaluated. `N` is
            the number of coordinates at which the contractions are evaluated.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If contractions is not a `GeneralizedContractionShell` instance.
            If points is not a two-dimensional `numpy` array with 3 columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    basis : list/tuple of GeneralizedContractionShell
        Shells of generalized contractions.
    points : np.ndarray(N, 3)
        Cartesian coordinates of the points in space (in atomic units) where the basis
        functions are evaluated.
        Rows correspond to the points and columns correspond to the :math:`x, y, \text{and} z`
        components.
    transform : np.ndarray(K, K_cont)
        Transformation matrix from the basis set in the given coordinate system (e.g. AO) to linear
        combinations of contractions (e.g. MO).
        Transformation is applied to the left, i.e. the sum is over the index 1 of `transform`
        and index 0 of the array for contractions.
        Default is no transformation.
    coord_type : {"cartesian", list/tuple of "cartesian" or "spherical", "spherical"}
        Types of the coordinate system for the contractions.
        If "cartesian", then all of the contractions are treated as Cartesian contractions.
        If "spherical", then all of the contractions are treated as spherical contractions.
        If list/tuple, then each entry must be a "cartesian" or "spherical" to specify the
        coordinate type of each `GeneralizedContractionShell` instance.
        Default value is "spherical".

    Returns
    -------
    eval_array : np.ndarray(K, N)
        Evaluations of the basis functions at the given points.
        If keyword argument `transform` is provided, then the transformed basis functions will be
        evaluated at the given points.
        `K` is the total number of basis functions within the given basis set.
        `N` is the number of coordinates at which the contractions are evaluated.
