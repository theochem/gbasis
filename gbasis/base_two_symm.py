        Notes
        -----
        The next level of classes will be the construction of specific arrays given a set of
        contracted Cartesian Gaussians. The keyword arguments will be different depending on its
        functionality. You should use explicit keyword arguments when defining this function, rather
        than the arbitrary number of keywords (as is done here).

        The methods `construct_array_cartesian`, `construct_array_spherical`, and
        `construct_array_spherical_lincomb` depend on this function to produce an array whose first
        and second indices correspond to the contraction (within a generalized contraction) and
        the angular momentum vector of `contractions_one`, and third and fourth indices correspond
        to the contraction (within a generalized contraction) and the angular momentum vector of
        `contractions_two`,. These other methods **will** fail with little warning if the shape of
        the output is different. Even if both `contractions_one` and `contractions_two` are
        segmented contractions, the first and third indices must correspond to the contraction.
        In other words, the shape must still be (1, L_1, 1, L_2).
