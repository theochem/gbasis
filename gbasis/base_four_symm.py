        Notes
        -----
        The next level of classes will be the construction of specific arrays given a set of
        contracted Cartesian Gaussians. The keyword arguments will be different depending on its
        functionality. You should use explicit keyword arguments when defining this function, rather
        than the arbitrary number of keywords (as is done here).

        The methods `construct_array_cartesian`, `construct_array_spherical`, and
        `construct_array_lincomb` depend on this function to produce an array with dimensions 0, 1
        corresponding to the contraction (within a generalized contraction) and angular momentum
        vector of `cont_one`, dimensions 2, 3 corresponding to the contraction
        (within a generalized contraction) and angular momentum vector of `cont_two`, and so
        on for `cont_three` and `cont_four`. These other methods **will** fail with little warning
        if the shape of the output is different.
        Even if all of `cont1`, `cont2`, `cont3`, and `cont4` are segmented contractions,
        dimensions 0, 2, 4, and 6 must correspond to the contraction. In other words, the shape must
        still be (1, L_1, 1, L_2, 1, L_3, 1, L_4).

        Parameters
        ----------
        transform : np.ndarray(K_orbs, K_cont)
            Transformation matrix from contractions in the given coordinate system (e.g. AO) to
            linear combinations of contractions (e.g. MO).
            Transformation is applied to the left.
            Rows correspond to the linear combinations (i.e. MO) and the columns correspond to the
            contractions (i.e. AO).
        coord_type : list/tuple of str
            Types of the coordinate system for each GeneralizedContractionShell.
            Each entry must be one of "cartesian" or "spherical". If multiple
            instances of GeneralizedContractionShell are given but only one string
            ("cartesian" or "spherical") is provided in the list/tuple, all of the
            contractions will be treated according to that string.
        kwargs : dict
            Other keyword arguments that will be used to construct the array.
            These keyword arguments are passed directly to `construct_array_spherical`, which will
            then pass it down to `construct_array_contraction`. See `construct_array_contraction`
            for details on the keyword arguments.

        Returns
        -------
        array : np.ndarray(K_orbs, K_orbs, K_orbs, K_orbs, ...)
            Array whose first four indices are associated with the linear combinations of the
            contractions.
            Dimensions 0, 1, 2 and 3 of the array correspond to the linear combination of contracted
            spherical Gaussians. `K_orbs` is the number of basis functions produced after the
            linear combinations.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If `coord_type` is not a list/tuple of the strings 'cartesian' or 'spherical'.
