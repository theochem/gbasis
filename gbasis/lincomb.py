def lincomb_blocks_evals(contractions, eval_func, trans_blocks, **kwargs):
    """Return linear transformation of the evaluations of the given contractions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    contractions : list/tuple of ContractedCartesianGaussians
        Contractions that will be used to generate the function evaluations.
    eval_func : function
        Function for evaluating the Cartesian contraction or its derivative.
        Input of the function is a ContractedCartesianGaussians instance and the keyword arguments.
        Output of the function is an array whose first index corresponds to the contractions of the
        given ContractedCartesianGaussians instance.
    trans_blocks : iterable of np.ndarray
        Transformations of each set of contractions that corresponds to a
        ContractedCartesianGaussians instance.
        Each transformation matrix applies from the left, i.e. the number of columns of the
        transformation matrix should match the number of contractions for the corresponding
        ContractedCartesianGaussians instance.
    kwargs
        Keyword arguments that are used for calling the `eval_func`

    Returns
    -------
    func_output : np.ndarray
        Output of the function.
        Output has the same shape as the output of a `eval_func` call past the 0th dimension. The
        0th dimension has the same size as the total number of contractions.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `contractions` is not a list/tuple of ContractedCartesianGaussians instances.
        If `trans_blocks` is not an interable of np.ndarray instances.
    ValueError
        If the number of elements in `contractions` and `trans_blocks` are not equal.
        If a ContractedCartesianGaussians instance in `contractions` does not have the same number
        of contractions as there are columns in the corresponding transformation matrix.
        If the output of `eval_func` for all of the ContractedCartesianGaussians instances do not
        have the same shape past the first dimension, i.e. `output.shape[1:]`.
