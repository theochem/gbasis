        Parameters
        ----------
        contractions : GeneralizedContractionShell
            Contracted Cartesian Gaussians (of the same shell) that will be used to construct an
            array.

        array_contraction : np.ndarray(M, L_cart, ...)
            Array associated with the given instance(s) of `GeneralizedContractionShell`.
            Dimension 0 corresponds to segmented contractions within the given generalized
            contraction (same exponents and angular momentum, but different coefficients). `M` is
            the number of segmented contractions with the same exponents (and angular momentum).
            Dimension 1 corresponds to angular momentum vector. `L_cart` is the number of Cartesian
            contractions for the given angular momentum.

        Notes
        -----
        The next level of classes will be the construction of specific arrays given a set of
        contracted Cartesian Gaussians. The keyword arguments will be different depending on its
        functionality. You should use explicit keyword arguments when defining this function, rather
        than the arbitrary number of keywords (as is done here).

        The methods `construct_array_cartesian`, `construct_array_spherical`, and
        `construct_array_lincomb` depend on this function to produce an array with dimension 0
        corresponding to the contraction (within a generalized contraction) and dimension 1
        corresponding to the angular momentum vector. These other methods **will** fail with little
        warning if the shape of the output is different. Even if there is only one contraction (i.e.
        segmented contraction), the first index must correspond to the contraction. In other words,
        the shape must still be (1, L, N).
