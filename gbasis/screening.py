"""1 and 2-index screening functions"""

def is_two_index_overlap_screened(contractions_one, contractions_two, tol_screen):
    r"""Return True if the integral should be screened.

    .. math::
           d_{A_s;B_t} > \sqrt{-\frac{\alpha_{ min(\alpha_{s,A})} +
           \alpha_{ min(\alpha_{t,B})} }{ \alpha_{ min(\alpha_{s,A})}
            \alpha_{ min(\alpha_{t,B})} } \ln \varepsilon }

    where :math:`d` is the cut-off distance at which shells do not interact with each other.
    :math:`A` and `B` are the atoms each contraction are respectively centered on.
    :math: `\alpha` is the gaussian exponent
    :math: `s` and `t` index primitive Gaussian shells centered on atom `A` and `B` respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    contractions_one : GeneralizedContractionShell
        Contracted Cartesian Gaussians (of the same shell) associated with the first index of
        the integral.
    contractions_two : GeneralizedContractionShell
        Contracted Cartesian Gaussians (of the same shell) associated with the second index of
        the integral.
    tol_screen : float, optional
        The tolerance used for screening two-index integrals. The `tol_screen` is combined with the
        minimum contraction exponents to compute a cutoff which is compared to the distance between
        the contraction centers to decide whether the integral should be set to zero.

    Returns
    -------
    value : `bool`
        If integral should be screened, return `True`
