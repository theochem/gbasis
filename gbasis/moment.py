        """Return the evaluations of the given contractions at the given coordinates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        contractions_one : ContractedCartesianGaussians
            Contracted Cartesian Gaussians (of the same shell) associated with the first index of
            the array.

        moment_orders : np.ndarray(D, 3)
            Orders of the moment for each dimension (x, y, z).
            Note that a two dimensional array must be given, even if there is only one set of orders
            of the moment.

        Returns
        -------
        array_contraction : np.ndarray(M_1, L_cart_1, M_2, L_cart_2, D)
            Moment associated with the given instances of ContractedCartesianGaussians.
            First axis corresponds to the segmented contraction within `contractions_one`. `M_1` is
            the number of segmented contractions with the same exponents (and angular momentum)
            associated with the first index.
            Second axis corresponds to the angular momentum vector of the `contractions_one`.
            `L_cart_1` is the number of Cartesian contractions for the given angular momentum
            associated with the first index.
            Third axis corresponds to the segmented contraction within `contractions_two`. `M_2` is
            the number of segmented contractions with the same exponents (and angular momentum)
            associated with the second index.
            Fourth axis corresponds to the angular momentum vector of the `contractions_two`.
            `L_cart_2` is the number of Cartesian contractions for the given angular momentum
            associated with the second index.
            Fifth axis corresponds to the orders of the moments. `D` is the number of orders for
            which the moment is computed.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If contractions_one is not a ContractedCartesianGaussians instance.
            If contractions_two is not a ContractedCartesianGaussians instance.
            If moment_coord is not a one-dimensional numpy array with 3 elements.
            If moment_orders is not a two-dimensional numpy array with 3 columns and dtype int.

        Notes
        -----
        Even though it will be faster to access the different orders of moments if it was associated
        with the first axis, the API will be consistent with the rest of the BaseTwoSymmetric class
        if the first four indices correspond to the segmented contraction and the angular momentum
        vector. If many orders of moments are calculated (the exact number depends on the size of
        the basis set), then it may be faster to access the moments if the fifth axis is moved back
        to the front prior to the access. Use `np.transpose(array, (4, 0, 1, 2, 3))` to change the
        order.
