class PointChargeIntegral(BaseTwoIndexSymmetric):
    r"""General class for calculating one-electron integrals for interaction with a point charge.

    One electron integrals are assumed to have the following form:
    .. math::

        \int \phi_a(\mathbf{r}) \phi_b(\mathbf{r}) g(|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_C|, Z) d\mathbf{r}

    where :math:`\phi_a` is Gaussian contraction on the left, :math:`\phi_b` is the Gaussian
    contraction on the right, :math:`\mathbf{R}_C` is the position of the point charge, :math:`Z` is
    the charge at the point charge, and :math:`g(|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_C|, Z)` determines the
    type of the one-electorn integral.

    """

    @staticmethod
    def boys_func(orders, weighted_dist):
        r"""Return the value of Boys function for the given orders and weighted distances.

        The Coulombic Boys function can be written as a renormalized special case of the Kummer
        confluent hypergeometric function, as derived in Helgaker (eq. 9.8.39).

        Parameters
        ----------
        orders : np.ndarray(M, 1, 1, 1)
            Differentiation order of the helper function.
            Same as m in eq. 23, Aldrichs, R. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2006, 8, 3072-3077.
            `M` is the number of orders that will be evaluated.
        weighted_dist : np.ndarray(1, N, K_b, K_a)
            Weighted interatomic distances.
            .. math::

                \frac{\alpha_i \beta_j}{\alpha_i + \beta_j} * ||R_{PC}||^2

            where :math:`\alpha_i` is the exponent of the ith primitive on the left side and the
            :math:`\beta_j` is the exponent of the jth primitive on the right side.
            `N` is the number of point charges. `K_a` and `K_b` are the number of primitives on the
            left and right side, respectively. Note that the index 2 corresponds to the primitive on
            the right side and the index 3 corresponds to the primitive on the left side.

        Returns
        -------
        boys_eval : np.ndarray(M, N, K_b, K_a)
            Output is the Boys function evaluated for each order and the weighted interactomic
            distance.

        Notes
        -----
        There's some documented instability for hyp1f1, mainly for large values or complex numbers.
        In this case it seems fine, since m should be less than 10 in most cases, and except for
        exceptional cases the input, while negative, shouldn't be very large. In scipy > 0.16, this
        problem becomes a precision error in most cases where it was an overflow error before, so
        the values should be close even when they are wrong.

        To use another `boys_func`, simply overwrite this function (via monkeypatching or
        inheritance) with the desired boys function. Make sure to follow the same API, i.e. *have
        the same inputs including their shapes and types*. Note that the index `1` corresponds to
        the primitive on the right side and the index `2` correspond to the primitive on the left
        side.
