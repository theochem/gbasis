def eval_contractions(coords, R_x, R_y, R_z, angmom_comps, alphas, prim_coeffs, norm):
    """Return the evaluation of a Cartesian contraction. 
    Note that it was addapted from the evals/_deriv.py file in the gbasis package to match the autograd API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coords : np.ndarray(3)
        Point in space where the derivative of the Gaussian primitive is evaluated.
        Coordinates must be given as a one(!) dimensional array.
    center : np.ndarray(3,)
        Center of the Gaussian primitive.
    angmom_comps : np.ndarray(1, 3)
        Components of the angular momentum, :math:`(a_x, a_y, a_z)`.
        Angular momentum components must be given as a two dimensional array, even if only one
        set of components is given.
    alphas : np.ndarray(K,)
        Values of the (square root of the) precisions of the primitives.
    prim_coeffs : np.ndarray(K, 1)
        Contraction coefficients of the primitives.
        The coefficients always correspond to generalized contractions, i.e. two-dimensional array
        where the first index corresponds to the primitive and the second index corresponds to the
        contraction (with the same exponents and angular momentum).
    norm : np.ndarray(1, K)
        Normalization constants for the primitives in each contraction.

    Returns
    -------
    derivative : np.ndarray(M, L, N)
        Evaluation of the derivative at each given coordinate.
        Dimension 0 corresponds to the contraction, with `M` as the number of given contractions.
        Dimension 1 corresponds to the angular momentum vector, ordered as in `angmom_comps`.
        Dimension 2 corresponds to the point at which the derivative is evaluated, ordered as in
        `coords`.

    Notes
    -----
    The input is not checked. This means that you must provide the parameters as they are specified
    in the docstring. They must all be `numpy` arrays with the **correct shape**.

    Pople style basis sets are not supported. If multiple angular momentum vectors (with different
    angular momentum) and multiple contraction coefficients are provided, it is **not assumed** that
    the angular momentum vector should be paired up with the contraction coefficients. In fact, each
    angular momentum vector will create multiple contractions according to the given coefficients.
