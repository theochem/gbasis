    "Gbasis includes a python interface to [`Libcint`](https://github.com/sunqm/libcint) library. To access the interface a `CBasis` objects needs to be initialized, which needs as arguments `basis`, list of atom elements and coordinates in atomic units (Bohr). Different from native functionality in Gbasis, Libcint does not work with mix type basis, meaning that all shells passed have to be in either cartesian or spherical coordinates. To showcase its functionality below we compute again the same energy terms. Note: To execute the code Libcint must be installed."
