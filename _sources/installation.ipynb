        "\n",
        "2. **Slow and Smart.** In addition to the four variations in the quick and dirty method, the slow and smart can be used with `pip` or just with `setup.py`. You also have the options to use SSH or HTTPS protocols to clone the git repository. Pick whichever works best for you.\n",
